#Nugit

Welcome to NuGit. The next evolution in [NuGet](http://nuget.org).

Add open source to your next project faster via NuGit. 
Integration with github means you always have access to the latest commits. 
By leveraging NuGets package management features with our automated pacakge 
creation, open source has never been easier!

##About
Nugit was created to address a need for adding code-snippets without having to go through the tedious process of
packaging an entire library or simple [gists](http://gist.github.com). We realized that NuGet already provided all
the features necessary to accomplish this.

##It's easy
Just [add a git](/package/create) and you're already done. Package creation is based on your github repo so there's
no settings here you need to address. Titles and descriptions and all the files necessary are based on your repo. 
[Here](http://github.com/Buildstarted/Nugit-Sample-Project) is a sample repo to get you started.

##Future
Many new features are in the works. This is a public preview to see how to proceed. Let us know what you
think. We're slowly working on documentation. You can help by forking our [documentation](https://github.com/Buildstarted/Nugit-Documentation) repo.
