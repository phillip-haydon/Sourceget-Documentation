#Nugit

Welcome to NuGit. The next evolution in [NuGet](http://nuget.org).

Add open source to your next project faster via NuGit. 
Integration with Github means you always have access to the latest commits. 
By leveraging NuGet's package management features with our automated pacakge creation, distributing your open source has never been easier!

##How easy is it?
Just [add a repo](/user/repos) and you're done.
Package creation is based on your Github repo so there's no settings here you need to address.
Titles and descriptions and all the files necessary are based on your repo. 
[Here](http://github.com/Buildstarted/Nugit-Sample-Project) is a sample repo to get you started.
