#About Nugit

This site was conceived by [Ben Dornis](http://buildstarted.com) as a way to easily create packages from Github repos.
It's gone through many revisions as the core functionality was revised and built upon through the advice and support of the following.

##Thanks goes to the following
* [Hugo Bonacci](http://hugoware.net) (Site design)
* [Orni Eini](http://ayende.com/blog) (RavenDB)
* [Paul Betts](http://blog.paulbetts.org/) (Github integation and direction)
* [Rob Conery](http://wekeroad.com/) (Some ideas and direction)
* Roy Haddad (Random code)


##Special Thanks
* [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) for putting up with me and all my questions.
Without him and his support this site wouldn't be nearly what it is today. His advice has been invaluable to me.
* [David Fowler](http://weblogs.asp.net/davidfowler/) and his wonderful [chatapp](http://chatapp.apphb.com). I pestered him non-stop about how Nuget works.


##Open source
This site will be open-sourced shortly and will be hosted on Github.
